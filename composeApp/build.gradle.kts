/**
 * Puts the package's dependencies right once jpackage is done.
 *
 * Two problems, one fix. libVLC is dlopen-ed through JNA and ffmpeg is spawned per track, so
 * neither appears in any dependency scan and the package would install and then silently play
 * nothing. And jpackage derives the rest from the build machine, where Ubuntu 24.04 renamed half
 * of them for the 64-bit time_t transition (libasound2 -> libasound2t64) while Debian 12 kept the
 * old names — so a package built on one does not install on the other at all.
 *
 * The script writes the missing names in and gives every library an alternative through `|`, which
 * is what dpkg has for exactly this. It rewrites only the control member, so the 170 MB of data is
 * never unpacked and repacked.
 *
 * In afterEvaluate because the Compose plugin registers its packaging tasks after this script is
 * evaluated.
